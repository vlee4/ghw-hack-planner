# Hack Planner

This is a project made during MLH's Global Hack Week.

Thus far it includes a Python backend, created using Flask. Views are provided via Flask's `render_template` function, which serves the views in the `/templates` directory as specified by the routes in `app.py`.

# Setup

1. Create a virtual env with: ` python3 -m venv env`
2. Activate the virtual env with: `source env/bin/activate`

To close the virtual environment: type `deactivate` in the terminal

# Run the app

While in the home directory, type `flask run` in the terminal.
